# Getting started

## About this project

This project is a way to maximize the capabilities of the Ender 5 Max. Creality leaves a lot of performance on the table, as well as made questionable decisions with the electronics.

!!! danger "Advanced Project"

    This project is not for the faint of heart. You will be replacing all of the core electronics and the toolhead with custom parts. This projects comes with no warranty, and I do not claim any responsibility for damage to the printer, you, or to your housing. Fires are a serious risk when doing this project, and the danger of electrocution is present when dealing with mains voltage.

    **You have been warned**
